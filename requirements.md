# Project Requirements

Hey there! You killed your first interview and now we want to put your skills to the test! Our design team has created a mockup of a simple landing page with a submission form. Your task is to build it out according to the mock and hook it up to a back end implementation. You are free to use any packages or frameworks that you see fit to complete the project. The requirements are as follows:

## Front End

- Build out the landing page in accordance with the given mock
- Optimize the landing page to load as quickly as possible
- Ensure the landing page looks beautiful across all devices and resolutions
- Include form validation
    + First and Last Name fields are required
    + Email is required and must be a valid email address
    + Zip Code field is required
- The form should be submitted over AJAX

## Back End

- Build out a database in MySQL or Sqlite to house the form data
- The form's zip code field should be converted into a latitude and longitude and stored in their associated columns in the database (`lat` and `lon`).
- The `email` field should be unique, that is, the same email can only be used once.

## Documentation

Upon designing and implementing your solution, please document your implementation in the [project's readme](./readme.md). 

## Bonus Points

- Unit Testing on front or back end code, or both
- Usage of dependency managers to handle front and back end dependencies
- Demonstrate a solid working knowledge of Git

## Grading

You will be graded on the following concepts in no particular order:

- Ability to comprehend and implement the project as a whole
- Ability to take a design mock and translate it seamlessly into code
- Knowledge and adherence to development standards
- Ability to understand and account for various use cases
- Strong understanding of web applicaton security
- Strong understanding of good software design patterns
